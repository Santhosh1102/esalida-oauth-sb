By default on running the project dummy users and tenant is created. The following are the details of it.

We need to create a schema named "esalidaoauth".

Login url: localhost:4001/oauth/token?username={username}&password={password}&grant_type=password
with basic authentication username=oauth-client, password=secret

Mock user details:

username        password        role
santhosh        password        ADMIN
murthyavsn      password        MANAGER
sravani         password        EMPLOYEE
madhu           password        EMPLOYEE
